          <p>One of the most fun production experiences I've had was creating and reporting for "NYUMM," a culinary adventure to some of New York's best eateries. On this excursion for #HashtagNYU, I hosted and reported on a trip to John's Pizzeria in the West Village of New York City for the segment NYum which I created with videographer Sandra Tan.</p>

          <p>During high school I was an active member of "Central Intelligence" our school's broadcast journalism program. During my tenure we were ranked the #1 broadcast journalism program in the country, and my partner and I were the recipients of three Mid-America Student Emmy awards. Through this program I was able to pair my love of storytelling, production, and personal interests such as this inside look into "Girls on the Run."</p>

          <p>For my latest adventure, I ventured to Tanzania for a couple of months after graduation. I had the amazing opportunity to dive the Mnemba Atoll in Zanzibar, volunteer aind live at the Upendo orphanage in Moshi my friend helps run, and hike Mount Kilimanjaro- the tallest peak on the Afrcan continent.</p>

          <p>In the fall of 2014 I studied abroad with Semester at Sea. I lived on a 1,000 passenger ship for four months and traveled to 16 countries across four continents.</p>
